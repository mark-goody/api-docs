For a guide on how to create an order batch, see the Getting Started guide for the [Automation API Getting Started](/automation-api/create-an-order) guide or the [Commerce API Getting Started](/commerce-api/create-an-order) guide.

### Order batches with 10 or fewer recipients

Order batches with 10 or fewer recipients are created synchronously, and the returned `status` field will be `completed`. The orders and order links are available immediately inside the `orders_preview` field (which returns the first 10 orders).

## Order batches with more than 10 recipients

Order batches with more than 10 recipients are created asynchronously, and the order batch will have a `status` of `pending`. The orders and gift links won't be available until the order batch is finished processing synchronously. You can check the status of the order batch by calling the [`/order_batches/:id`](retrieve-an-order-batch) endpoint, or by receiving a webhook notification on the [`order_batch.completed`](/webhooks/events/order_batch.completed) event.

Once an order batch is created, you can access all of the orders by calling the `/order_batches/:id/orders` endpoint, where you can paginate through the list of orders. If your use case always sends 10 or fewer orders at a time, you can just use the `orders_preview` field on the order batch which gives you the first 10 orders.

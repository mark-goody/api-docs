title: "Create a commerce user payment method"

<Note>Only for the Commerce API.</Note>

Apps using the Commerce API can embed Goody's credit card form into their application to allow the app's end users to enter their credit card to save a payment method. Users can then use that payment method to pay for orders.

Call this endpoint to create a payment method associated with a commerce user; provide the user ID as `commerce_end_user_id`. Then, use the returned payment method `id` as the `payment_method_id` in the [Create an Order Batch](/api-reference/order-batches/create-an-order-batch) endpoint along with the `commerce_end_user_id`.
